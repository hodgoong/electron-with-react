## Electron with React

The purpose of this repo is to provide minimal setup to start an Electron development based on React. It is built based on create-react-app(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and electron-quick-start(https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start). Some of the works were done based on the tutorial here: https://medium.com/@kitze/%EF%B8%8F-from-react-to-an-electron-app-ready-for-production-a0468ecb1da3.

The example is from https://codingthesmartway.com/learn-redux-introduction-to-state-management-with-react/
